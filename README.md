# Expert-User-Interfaces-for-Domain-Specialist-Access-to-Algorithmic-Solutions

Sort of inspired by https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/cs347/s24/projects/1/possible-projects/#15-yo-ill-solve-it

## Problems
1. 1:1 scheduling
2. TA Scheduling
3. Group/team formation

## UX Considerations
1. how to present variables/weights/formulae to the ProblemHaver
  2. are they zero sum
  3. will person choose values that aren't important to base 10
4. show multiple every time
5. Tinder thing
6. permit fixing partial solution
7. permit manual partial solution and extrapolate the weights

## Sources of inspiration/example
1. scheduling polls (whentomeet, whenisgood)
2. multi dimension reduction visual analytics, drag 2 points and have thing search for parmas maybe this paper? https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2939502.2939505 
3. questionnaire software (jmu.questionpro.com)

## Roles
1. ProblemHaver
