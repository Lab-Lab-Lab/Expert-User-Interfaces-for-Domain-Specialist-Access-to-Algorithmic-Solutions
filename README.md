# Expert-User-Interfaces-for-Domain-Specialist-Access-to-Algorithmic-Solutions

Sort of inspired by https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/cs347/s24/projects/1/possible-projects/#15-yo-ill-solve-it

(professional level webapp that can be used to poll people and create schedules)

## Problems
1. 1:1 scheduling
2. TA Scheduling
3. Group/team formation

## UX Considerations
1. how to present variables/weights/formulae to the ProblemHaver
  2. should weights add up to some value?
  3. should weights be values that aren't important to base 10?
4. show multiple every time
5. Tinder thing
6. permit fixing partial solution
7. permit manual partial solution and extrapolate the weights

## Sources of inspiration/example
1. scheduling polls (whentomeet, whenisgood)
2. multi dimension reduction visual analytics, drag 2 points and have thing search for parmas maybe this paper? https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2939502.2939505 
3. questionnaire software (jmu.questionpro.com)

## Roles
1. ProblemHaver - The individual who has a scheduling problem that needs to be solved.
2. Producer - The resource that is being offered.
3. Consumer - The ones being offered the resource.
